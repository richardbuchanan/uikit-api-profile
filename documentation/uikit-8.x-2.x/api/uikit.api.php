 * @defgroup getting_started Getting started with UIkit
 * @{
 * @lead get_familiar Get familiar with the basic setup and structure of UIkit 8.
 * UIkit 8 does not come with the required UIkit framework files because, in
 * general,
 * @link https://www.drupal.org/node/422996 3rd party libraries and content are forbidden @endlink
 * from being committed to a reporsitory for projects hosted on
 * @link drupal.org drupal.org @endlink. We instead use
 * @link https://cdnjs.com cdnjs.com @endlink to retrieve the
 * @link https://cdnjs.com/libraries/uikit UIkit library @endlink.
 *
 * This also makes the footprint of our repository smaller. Simply follow the
 * instructions below to get started with using UIkit 8.
 *

 * article before installing UIkit 8. We only provide the download methods
 * below, not how to install themes.
 *
 * @heading h3 NOTE: Recommended for theme developers only @endheading
 * Since UIkit 8 is still in development, none of the following ways to
 * download UIkit 8 are recommended for use on production sites. UIkit 8 is
 * still considered unstable.

/**

 * @{
 * @lead settings Customizing UIkit 8 from the Drupal administration back-end.
 * UIkit comes with an extensive variety of theme settings to configure almost
 * all themeable aspects of your Drupal site. This topic provides a brief
 * overview of these theme settings to customize the look of your website.
 *
 * @subtitle Jump to a section
 * - @ref theme_styles
 * - @ref layout
 * - @ref navigations
 *
 * @section theme_styles Theme styles
 * UIkit comes with a basic theme and two neat themes to get you started. Here
 * you can select which base style to start with.
 *
 * @divider
 *
 * @section layout Layout
 * Apply our fully responsive fluid grid system and panels, common layout parts
 * like blog articles and comments and useful utility classes.
 *
 * @heading h3 Page Layout @endheading
 * Page layout settings are available for standard, tablet and mobile layouts,
 * allowing you to arrange the main content and sidebar regions in various ways.
 * Each layout is independent of the others, giving you many ways to present
 * your content to your users.
 *
 * Additional page layout settings:
 * - Page Container: Add the .uk-container class to the page container to give
 *   it a max-width and wrap the main content of your website. For large screens
 *   it applies a different max-width.
 * - Page Centering: To center the page container, use the .uk-container-center
 *   class.
 * - Page Margin: Select the margin to add to the top and bottom of the page
 *   container. This is useful, for example, when using the gradient style with
 *   a centered page container and a navbar.
 *
 * @heading h3 Region Layout @endheading
 * Change region layout settings on a per region basis. You can currently apply
 * the following two components to each region (more will be added in the
 * future):
 * - Panel
 * - Block
 *
 * @divider
 *
 * @section navigations Navigations
 * UIkit offers different types of navigations, like navigation bars and side
 * navigations. Use breadcrumbs or a pagination to steer through articles.
 *
 * @heading h3 Navigation Bar @endheading
 * Configure settings for the navigation bar, where the primary and secondary
 * menus reside. Configurable options:
 * - Navbar container: Configure settings for the navigation bar container with
 *   the following options:
 *   - Container: Add the .uk-container class to the navbar container to give it
 *     a max-width and wrap the navbar of your website. For large screens it
 *     applies a different max-width.
 *   - Centering: To center the navbar container, use the .uk-container-center
 *     class.
 *   - Navbar attached: Adds the .uk-navbar-attached class to optimize the
 *     navbar's styling to be attached to the top of the viewport. For example,
 *     rounded corners will be removed.
 * - Navbar margin: Configure the top and bottom margin to apply to the navbar.
 *
 * @heading h3 Local Tasks @endheading
 * Configure settings for the local tasks menus.
 * - Primary tasks style: Select the style to apply to the primary local tasks.
 * - Secondary tasks style: Select the style to apply to the secondary local
 *   tasks.
 *
 * @heading h3 Breadcrumbs @endheading
 * Configure settings for breadcrumb navigation.
 * - Display breadcrumbs: Check this box to display the breadcrumb.
 * - Display home link in breadcrumbs: Check this box to display the home link
 *   in breadcrumb trail.
 * - Display current page title in breadcrumbs: Check this box to display the
 *   current page title in breadcrumb trail.

/**
 * @defgroup uikit_themeable UIkit theme implementations
 * @{
 * @lead implementations Functions and templates for the user interface to be implemented by UIkit 8.
 * Drupal's default template renderer is a simple PHP parsing engine that
 * includes the template and stores the output. The default template engine in
 * Drupal 8 is Twig. This is the template engine utilized by UIkit 8.
 *
 * UIkit implements hook overrides by the use of template files and an include
 * file, which are used to override the default implementations provided by
 * Drupal. The folder structure of UIkit helps identify whether the template is
 * overriding a default template or theme hook:
 * - templates: Overrides default templates
 * - includes/theme.inc: Overrides default theme hooks
 *
 * Contrary to Drupal 7, in Drupal 8 template files (*.html.twig files) must be
 * stored in the 'templates' sub folder. The templates folder is further divided
 * into various elemental folders (i.e. block, layout, navigation, etc.). This
 * structure will make it easier to find a template file during development of a
 * sub-theme.
