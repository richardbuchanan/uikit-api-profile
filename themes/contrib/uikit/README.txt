INTRODUCTION
------------

The UIkit theme is a lightweight frontend framework with a comprehensive
collection of HTML, CSS, and JS components. It is a great alternative to other
frontend frameworks, plus is very lightweight and provides a lot of useful tools
for customizing with very little requirements.
