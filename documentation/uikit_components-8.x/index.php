 * @section about_uikit About UIkit Components
 * The UIkit components module provides additional components and functionality
 * to the UIkit base theme.
 *
 * Some aspects of the frontend cannot be themed without going through the
 * backend, such as empty navbar links. With this module you can add more
 * functionality to the UIkit frontend through the Drupal backend without the
 * need for contributed modules which may add more functionality than needed.
