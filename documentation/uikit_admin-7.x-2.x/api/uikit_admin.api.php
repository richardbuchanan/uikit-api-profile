 * @lead implementations Functions and templates for the user interface to be implemented by UIkit Admin 7.
 * Drupal's default template renderer is a simple PHP parsing engine that
 * includes the template and stores the output. Drupal's theme engines
 * can provide alternate template engines, such as XTemplate, Smarty and
 * PHPTal. The most common template engine is PHPTemplate (included with
 * Drupal and implemented in phptemplate.engine, which uses Drupal's default
 * template renderer. This is the template engine utilized by UIkit Admin.
 *
 * UIkit Admin implements hook overrides by the use of template files and an
 * include file, which are used to override the default implementations provided
 * by Drupal.
 *
 * The templates folder is further divided into the modules which provided the
 * default template. This structure will make it easier to find a template file
 * during development of a sub-theme.
