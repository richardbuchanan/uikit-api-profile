 * @section about_uikit About UIkit
 * UIkit is a lightweight and modular front-end framework for developing fast
 * and powerful web interfaces. This API site contains documentation for the
 * UIkit Drupal 7 theme. To view the official UIkit framework documentation,
 * please see @link https://getuikit.com/v2/index.html getuikit.com @endlink.
 *
 * UIkit gives you a comprehensive collection of HTML, CSS, and JS components
 * with configurable options built-in. This collection of small, responsive
 * components using consistent and conflict-free nameing conventions gives you
 * fine-grain control over the look and feel without conflicting with other
 * frameworks.
 *
 * With a mobile-first approach UIkit provides a consistent experience from
 * phones and tablets to desktops, without the need to worry about device sizes
 * and breakpoints.
 *
 * This site uses the 7.x-2.x branch of UIkit as a base theme. The footer
 * contains the current version and release date of the UIkit theme being used.
 * You can try out a demonstration of any release of UIkit by visiting
